1. Write an ARM assembly program that performs the addition of two immediate values: -44 and 4. Store the result in register R3. 
2. Write an ARM assembly code that subtracts R1 from R0, sets the condition flags, and adds R1 to R0 only if the result of the subtraction was negative (i.e., if the Minus flag is set). Use SUBS and conditional execution with ADDMIS.
3. Write an ARM assembly program that compares the values in R1 and R0, and if they are equal, adds R1 to R0. Use the CMP instruction followed by the conditional instruction ADDEQ.
